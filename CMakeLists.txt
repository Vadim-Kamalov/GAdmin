# We use the content of the JSON files from the `embed/` directory directly
# in the code by employing the `#embed` preprocessor directive from C++26.
# Converting these files to MessagePack format can reduce the binary size.
#
# It is recommended to enable this option when building for a release.
#
# This depends on the `mpk` command, which can be installed by running
# `cargo install msgpack-cli` or by installing it manually from its
# GitHub repository: https://github.com/pluots/mpk.
#
# After installation, please ensure that `mpk` is in your `PATH`.

# UPX is an advanced executable file compressor. It can reduce the size
# of a binary by approximately 50%-70%, while preserving the same functionality as
# before. Note that it can significantly slow down the compilation time.
#
# It is recommended to enable this option when building for a release.
#
# This depends on the `upx` command, which can be installed from the
# latest release: https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/latest.
#
# After installation, please ensure that `upx` is in your `PATH`.
