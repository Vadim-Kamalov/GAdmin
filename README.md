# GAdmin - Plugin Simplifying the Work of Administrators on Gambit-RP

**GAdmin is a forever free and open-source modification for San Andreas: Multiplayer.
It is designed to improve the user experience while administrating on the Gambit Role-Play server.**

The modification introduces new features for easy administration, for example:

- ImGui interface in spectator mode: player statistics, player's pressed keys, and buttons to interact
  with a player you're spectating (can be customized).
- Cheats: AirBreak, ClickWarp, Tracers, and WallHack.
- Statistics: online for a certain period of time, answers (`/ans`), punishments (`/ban`, `/kick`, etc.),
  and much more.
- FarChat: a window displaying almost all messages on the server, including actions (`/me`, `/do`, etc.).

These are just some of the many features available to you. Any feature can be configured in the way
you want: every setting has its own configuration options.

## Building the Code

The project is written using C++26 standards and is only for the GCC (MinGW) compiler, either version
`15.1.0` or any later version. To build the code, you will also need to have CMake version 4.0.0. Note
that we have two targets that will be compiled: `gadmin-loader.asi` (loads `gadmin.dll` and checks for
available updates to make suggestions to install if there are any) and `gadmin.dll` (if you want, you can
rename it to `gadmin.asi` and remove the loader to load independently from it).

We also have CMake options to significantly reduce the size of the binaries when compiling for release:

- `USE_EMBEDDED_MESSAGE_PACK`: We use the content of the JSON files from the `embed/` directory
   directly in the code by employing the `#embed` preprocessor directive from C++26. Converting these files
   to MessagePack format can reduce the binary size. When using this option, ensure you have installed
   [`msgpack-cli`](https://github.com/pluots/mpk) and that the `mpk` command is set in your `PATH`.

- `USE_UPX`: UPX is an advanced executable file compressor that can reduce the size of a binary by
  approximately 50%-70% while preserving its functionality. Note that it can significantly slow down
  the compilation time. When using this option, ensure you have installed
  [`upx`](https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/latest) and that the command is set in your `PATH`.

By default, when building for the release target, we add compiler and linker flags to optimize and reduce
binary sizes. We support two build targets: `Debug` and `Release`. Debug binaries will compile faster but will
be significantly larger (around ~150MB). You can set the build target by adding `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<your target>`
to the first command below.

```bash
# Configure the project with the options set to reduce binary size.
cmake -B build/ -DUSE_EMBEDDED_MESSAGE_PACK=ON -DUSE_UPX=ON

# Compile source files.
cmake --build build/

# Output: gadmin.dll gadmin-loader.asi
ls build/bin
```

## Installation

In order to use the plugin, you need to have the original GTA: San Andreas (`1.0 US`), its online
modification (`SA:MP v0.3.7-(R1/R3/R5/DL-1)`), a configured ASI loader, and two files from the latest release:
`gadmin-loader.asi` and `gadmin.dll`. Put these two files in the directory where your game is installed.
