This repository contains the source code of the **gadmin** script, as well as all libraries written/modified specifically for this script.
Also contains all imports (tables, functions, etc.). If you find an error related to the script, create a topic with the error in the appropriate [section](https://github.com/Vadim-Kamalov/GAdmin/issues). This source code is available to everyone under the standart [GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)](https://github.com/Vadim-Kamalov/GAdmin/blob/main/LICENSE).

- have the latest, stable version of the script (you can get it in the `Release` section);
- have all the libraries listed below;
- did not create the same topic with the error that was found earlier;

The name of the topic should reflect the whole essence of the error, there should be no "error on line 1894".<br>
Please note that if there is an error related to the fact that you have not installed a specific error, then this topic will be ignored and closed in the future.
