- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error.

### Contribution directly to the code base

To contribute directly in the code base, you can create [pull request(s)](https://github.com/Vadim-Kamalov/GAdmin/pulls). Before creating pull, make sure that your code is working and has no errors. Describe to us, what you have changed. And follow our style guide:

- Prefer double quotes instead of single quotes, since double quotes most often denote a string, and single quotes - a character.
- Use the camel case in naming variables, function, and the like. 
- To create a variable, declare it local, e.g `local someVariable = "Value"`. 
- There should be no transliteration in the names of anything.

Using this style of code, a pull request is highly likely to be accepted.
